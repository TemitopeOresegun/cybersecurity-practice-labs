# Defensive Security Intro - TryHackMe

Completed the **Defensive Security Intro** lab on TryHackMe.

Gained a clearer understanding of how Security Operations Center (SOC) teams monitor, detect and respond to threats.

Building technical foundations consistently as I transition into cybersecurity.
